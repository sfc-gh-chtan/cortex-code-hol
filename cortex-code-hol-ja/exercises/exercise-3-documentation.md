# Exercise 3: Stakeholder Documentation

## Objective

Generate professional technical documentation to present to leadership, including architecture diagrams, integration guides, and security documentation that will address their concerns.

**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Deliverables:**
- Architecture diagram (Mermaid)
- Data integration guide
- Security & compliance documentation

---

## Background

Your POC is ready, but before the leadership presentation, David Park (VP of Operations) requested technical documentation showing:
1. How Snowflake would integrate with your existing systems (Geneva, NetSuite, Salesforce)
2. Data flow architecture for real-time financial reporting
3. Security model for SOC 2 compliance

He specifically said:
> "Show me the SQL. I need to trust but verify."

This documentation will help you get buy-in from the technical stakeholders.

## Task 1: Generate Architecture Diagram (15 min)

### Step 1: Understand current state

```
Based on the company background in assets/customer-brief.md, summarize our 
current technical environment in a table:
- System name
- Purpose
- Data it contains
- Current integration method
```

### Step 2: Create proposed architecture diagram

```
Create a Mermaid architecture diagram showing how Snowflake would integrate 
with our systems at Pinnacle Financial. Proceed autonomously.

Include:

1. **Data Sources**
   - Geneva (portfolio accounting)
   - NetSuite (general ledger)
   - Salesforce (client data)

2. **Ingestion Layer**
   - How each source would connect to Snowflake
   - Data freshness expectations

3. **Snowflake Platform**
   - RAW / CURATED / ANALYTICS schemas
   - Cortex Analyst with semantic model
   - Snowflake Intelligence

4. **Consumption Layer**
   - Power BI (existing)
   - Snowflake Intelligence (new)
   - API access (future)

Add data latency annotations on each flow.
Use color coding: gray = existing, green = new.
```

### Step 3: Create security architecture diagram

```
Create a second Mermaid diagram focused on security architecture. Proceed autonomously.

1. Authentication flow (SSO integration)
2. Role hierarchy (who can see what)
3. Data masking for PII
4. Audit logging

Include the SOC 2 compliance touchpoints David mentioned.
```

### Step 4: Generate text-based version

For email/Slack sharing with stakeholders:

```
Convert the architecture diagram to:
1. ASCII art version for plain text
2. Bullet-point narrative I can present verbally
3. One-paragraph executive summary
```

---

## Task 2: Create Data Integration Guide (15 min)

### Step 1: Generate integration documentation

```
Create a technical integration guide for connecting our source systems to 
Snowflake if we move to production. Proceed autonomously. Include:

## Document Structure:
1. Executive Summary (1 paragraph for Margaret)
2. Technical Overview (for David)
3. Prerequisites & Requirements
4. Integration Details by Source System:
   - Geneva → Snowflake (portfolio data)
   - NetSuite → Snowflake (GL data)
   - Salesforce → Snowflake (client data)
5. Data Transformation Logic
6. Refresh Schedules
7. Error Handling & Monitoring
8. Timeline & Milestones

For each source system include:
- Connection method (Fivetran, Snowpipe, etc.)
- Tables to sync
- Incremental vs. full refresh
- Expected latency
```

### Step 2: Create data mapping document

```
Generate a data mapping document showing. Proceed autonomously.

| Source System | Source Table | Snowflake Table | Key Columns | Transform |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|

Cover the key tables for:
1. Client master data (Salesforce → dim_client)
2. Revenue data (Geneva → fact_revenue)
3. Expense data (NetSuite → fact_expense)
```

### Step 3: Generate validation queries

```
Create a set of data validation queries that David's team can run to verify 
the integration is working correctly (in production). Proceed autonomously.

1. Row count comparison (source vs. Snowflake)
2. Sum validation (revenue totals match)
3. Date range check (no missing days)
4. Referential integrity (all FKs resolve)
5. Data freshness (last update timestamp)

Format as executable SQL with comments explaining each check.
```

---

## Task 3: Create Security & Compliance Documentation (15 min)

### Step 1: Generate security documentation

```
Create a Security Architecture Document for Pinnacle Financial addressing 
David's concerns about data accuracy and Sarah's compliance requirements.
Proceed autonomously.

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - SSO integration options
   - Role-based access control model
   - Row-level security for client data

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption (at-rest, in-transit)
   - Dynamic data masking for PII
   - Column-level security for sensitive fields

3. **Audit & Compliance**
   - Query history retention
   - Access logging
   - SOC 2 Type II mapping
   - Regulatory reporting controls

4. **AI Governance**
   - Cortex Analyst guardrails
   - SQL approval workflows
   - Explainability requirements

Include specific Snowflake features that address each requirement.
```

### Step 2: Create role hierarchy diagram

```
Create a Mermaid diagram showing the proposed Snowflake role hierarchy.
Proceed autonomously.

ACCOUNTADMIN
└── SYSADMIN
    └── PINNACLE_ADMIN
        ├── PINNACLE_ANALYST (Finance team - full read)
        │   └── PINNACLE_VIEWER (Executives - dashboards only)
        ├── PINNACLE_COMPLIANCE (Sarah's team - audit access)
        └── PINNACLE_DATA_ENG (David's team - write access)

Show what each role can access (schemas, tables, sensitive columns).
```

### Step 3: Generate compliance checklist

```
Create a SOC 2 compliance checklist mapping Snowflake capabilities to 
Trust Service Criteria. Proceed autonomously.

| SOC 2 Criteria | Requirement | Snowflake Feature | Status |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|--------|

Cover:
- CC6.1 (Logical access controls)
- CC6.2 (Authentication)
- CC6.3 (Authorization)
- CC7.1 (System monitoring)
- CC7.2 (Anomaly detection)
```

## Task 4: Package Documentation (Bonus)

### Step 1: Create table of contents

```
Create a master documentation index that organizes all technical documents:

1. Architecture Overview
   - System architecture diagram
   - Security architecture diagram
2. Integration Guide
   - Source system connections
   - Data mapping
   - Validation queries
3. Security & Compliance
   - Access control model
   - SOC 2 compliance matrix
4. Operations
   - Runbooks (placeholder)
   - Monitoring (placeholder)

Format as a clickable table of contents.
```

### Step 2: Generate executive summary

```
Write a 1-page Technical Summary for Margaret Chen (CFO) that:

1. Explains the architecture in business terms
2. Highlights risk mitigation (addressing David's concerns)
3. Shows timeline to value
4. Includes a clear next-steps section

Avoid technical jargon - focus on outcomes.
```
