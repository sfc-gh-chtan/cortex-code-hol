## Getting Started

### Step 1: Move Lab Assets to an Accessible Location

Move this folder from your Downloads directory to a location Cortex Code can access, such as your Documents folder or a dedicated projects directory:

```bash
# Example: Move to Documents
mv ~/Downloads/cortex-code-hol-v3 ~/Documents/

# Or create a projects folder
mkdir -p ~/projects
mv ~/Downloads/cortex-code-hol-v3 ~/projects/
```

Then navigate to the folder in your terminal before launching Cortex Code.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Navigate to the lab folder
cd ~/Documents/cortex-code-hol-v3  # or wherever you moved it

# Launch Cortex Code
cortex
```

In Cortex Code, verify your Snowflake connection:
```
List my available Snowflake connections
```

If you need to add a connection, use `/add-connection`. See the [Cortex Code Getting Started Guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/cortex-code/cortex-code-cli) for connection configuration details.

### Step 2: Verify Available Skills

```
list skills
```

You should see `semantic-view-optimization` in the bundled skills.

### Step 3: Load Your Company Context

```
Read the company background from assets/customer-brief.md
```
